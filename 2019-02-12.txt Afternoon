This afternoon I changed the color of my header and section text as well as the text of my page names. I turned the page names into inline blocks with links you can click on. You should now be able to click on them to access different pages on my site. Each page has a title, which is the name of the page. They also have the link to every other page on the site. The About Me page has a paragraph telling the viewer who I am. The home page is a different color along with the inline blocks, which are now side-by-side the way I want them.
