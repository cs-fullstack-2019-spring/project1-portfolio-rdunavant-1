<p>I am a 28-year-old lifelong resident of Memphis, Tennessee. My interests include dogs, nature, cities and countries, houses, news, the paranormal, and people. My hobbies are comedy (recording myself pretending to be on stage), pranks, listening to music and the police scanner, and running. I love junk food. Every now and then, I like to reminisce about my past and plan new memories. My favorite places to vacation are Seaside, Florida and my grandmother's house on 400 acres of countryside.</p>
